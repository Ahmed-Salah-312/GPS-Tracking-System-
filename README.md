# GPS-Tracking-System-
In this project we developed the following system using TM4C123GH6PM LaunchPad: 1. The GPS subsystem stores the coordinates of the start point. 2. After reaching the destination point, the GPS subsystem stores the coordinates of the end point and calculates the total distance that was taken by the user.
